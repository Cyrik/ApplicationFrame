Application Frame
================

Application Frame is a small JavaScript Framework / Library. 

The core file 'af.js' contains the engine to manage one or more webapplications and different services / webworkers. The exact syntax and techniques to use af.js will be placed in the wiki soon. The lib and modules folders contain different modules which aren't realy related to af.js but are parts of the Library.

Application Frame will be compatible with:

- latest Google Chrome
- latest Opera
- [1] latest Geko Engine
- [X] latest Mozilla Add-on SDK
- latest WebRT from Mozilla
- latest B2G

Items marked with a 'X' aren't supportet at any way. Items marked with a number have special focus from a developer. All other should be compatible.
